# IITB-RISC-Multicycle

Designed the level-2 Hardware Flow Chart for 17 simple instructions like Add, Load, Store and Jump<br/>
Used multicycle approach and designed the datapath and Finite State Machine Controller for the HFC<br/>
Coded the entire datapath, FSM in VHDL and tested its functionality and correctness using a testbench<br/>
